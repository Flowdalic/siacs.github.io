          <h2>OMEMO Multi-End Message and Object Encryption</h2>
          <p>Send encrypted messages to someone who is currently offline, uses mulitple clients and simultaneously receive a copy of that message on all of your own devices.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Benefits</h2>
        <p>The OMEMO encryption (<strong>O</strong>MEMO <strong>M</strong>ulti-<strong>E</strong>nd <strong>M</strong>essage and <strong>O</strong>bject Encryption) gives you all the advantages you would expect from a modern-day encrpytion protocol like <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/">Future and Forward Secrecy</a> while allowing you to keep the benefits of <a href="http://conversations.im/#xmpp">message synchronization and offline delivery</a>.</p>
        <p>OMEMO not only gives you a stronger encryption than OpenPGP and OTR but is also much easier to setup. OMEMO is the encryption you can actually use in your daily life. Turn it on once and forget you ever did.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h2 class="text-center">Device Trust</h2>
        <p>With OMEMO you no longer trust user identities but device identities. If you are communicating with a contact for the first time or if that contact recently got a new device you will be presented with a fingerprint for that device. You can then either verify that fingerprint out of band (for example via a quick phone call) or if you are reasonbly sure that your transport is secure (for instance if you are chatting on the same, trusted server) you can choose to trust a device on first use. If you have trusted devices of your contact in the past you can also use those devices as a secure channel to verify the fingerprint of a new device.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h2 class="text-center">Background</h2>
        <p>OMEMO uses the <a href="https://github.com/trevp/axolotl/wiki">Axolotl ratchet</a> to establish secure sessions between every combination of devices for you and your contact. Those sessions are then being used to communicate a secure key to all devices. That key again is used to encrypt your messages with AES-GCM. OMEMO will generate a new key for every message. The long-living Axolotl sessions in the background deal with the challanges of message reordering, message loss and accidental duplication.</p>
        <p>Being build upon <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0163.html">PEP (Personal Eventing Protocol)</a> to announce the pre-keys used by Axolotl to establish new sessions OMEMO requires little to no change on the existing XMPP server infrastruktur.</p>
